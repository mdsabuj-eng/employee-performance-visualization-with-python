# Employee Performance Visualization with Python

This project demonstrates how to analyze and visualize employee performance and salary data using Python. The data is stored in a SQLite database, and the project covers common data analysis tasks like aggregation, KPI calculation, and multiple types of charts and plots using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## Features

- Connects to a remote SQLite database and loads tables into Pandas DataFrames  
- Performs SQL queries to calculate key metrics such as total employees per department, salary expenses, and average performance scores  
- Visualizes data using various chart types including bar charts, pie charts, line plots, heatmaps, box plots, and scatter plots  
- Displays KPIs as summary metrics in the console  
- Explores correlation between numeric variables with a heatmap
